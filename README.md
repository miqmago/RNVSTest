This project is std react-native project with three new files and one line in `index.android.js`. Please see discussion at https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/8528#issuecomment-221349748.

The main purpose is to show that react-native won't compile with the suggestions of the mentioned issue, neither will do intellisense and navigation in VSCode.

System: OSX El Capitan, 10.11.5
VSCode: 1.1.1-insider
Typescript: Version 1.9.0-dev.20160523-1.0

Uncomment lines with `// <-- This works` and comment lines with `// <-- This won't work` to make RN project work in android device.

    console.log('Replace "src/something" with "../something" to make it work');
